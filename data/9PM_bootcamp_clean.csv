SWIFT PURSUES THIS BY ENGAGING IN APPLIED FEMINIST INNOVATION STUDIES RESEARCH BETTER REFLECTING FEMINIST AND HUMAN-RIGHTS BASED APPROACHES. THIS WILL ENABLE TO FACILITATE A CHANGE OF FRAMING IN AGRICULTURE TO ADDRESS THE SOCIAL REALITIES THAT PERPETUATE INEQUALITIES. WOMEN, IN ALL OF THEIR DIVERSITY, PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS. THEIR KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, LABOUR AND LEADERSHIP, HOWEVER, ARE FREQUENTLY INVISIBLE AND UNDERVALUED. AT PRESENT, THE EUROPEAN AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IS CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH LEVELS OF INEQUALITY. THE MULTIPLE BARRIERS TO GENDER EQUALITY IN EUROPEAN AGRICULTURE ARE SOCIO-CULTURAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL, AND PERPETUATE WOMEN¿S INEQUALITY WITHIN THE MUTUALLY CONSTITUTING `PRODUCTIVE¿ SPHERE OF FARMING OUTPUTS AND IN THE `REPRODUCTIVE¿ SPHERE OF UNPAID AND UNDERVALUED LABOUR THAT OCCURS ON THE FARM, IN THE FAMILY AND COMMUNITY. SOME EXAMPLES INCLUDE I) UNEQUAL ACCESS TO LAND AND PRODUCTIVE RESOURCES, THAT SHAPE AND LIMIT WOMEN¿S PARTICIPATION IN AGRICULTURE, CONSTRUCTING GENDER ROLES AND IDENTITIES AND RESULTING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IN II) WOMEN UNDER-REPRESENTATION IN AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATIONS AND HOLDING VERY FEW DECISION-MAKING POSITIONS; III) CURRENT AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING THAT REINFORCE STEREOTYPES ABOUT FARMING AS A MALE ACTIVITY AND WHICH DO NOT ENCOURAGE YOUNG WOMEN TO PURSUE AGRICULTURAL CAREERS; IV) SOCIAL CLOSURE, CHARACTERISED BY INTERACTIONAL DYNAMICS OF DISCRIMINATION, EXCLUSION AND/OR HARASSMENT, THAT LEAD TO WOMEN BEING DISCOURAGED FROM TAKING UP TASKS OR ACQUIRING RELEVANT FARMING SKILLS. THE STRUCTURAL GENDER INEQUALITIES IN AGRICULTURE ARE ACUTELY FELT BY SOCIAL GROUPS THAT EXPERIENCE MULTIPLE AND INTERSECTING FORMS OF OPPRESSION, INCLUDING MIGRANT FARMWORKERS AND LGBTIQ+ FARMERS. THESE INTERSECTING FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION HAVE NOT YET BEEN EXTENSIVELY DOCUMENTED, HOWEVER, THEY CONSTITUTE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE IN RURAL AREAS IN EUROPE. ONE OF THE MAIN DIFFICULTIES FOR GENDER MAINSTREAMING IN AGRICULTURAL POLICIES IS THE FRAMING OF FOOD. THE EU¿S PRIMARY COMMITMENT TO PURELY ECONOMIC MEASURES OF VIABILITY OF FARMING BUSINESSES REFLECTS THE IDEA OF FOOD AS A COMMODITY THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE FORMS OF FARMING THAT TEND TO BE LED BY WOMEN. THE FRAMING OF FOOD AS A COMMODITY ALSO FAILS TO CAPTURE THE COMMITMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE REALISATION OF THE RIGHT TO ADEQUATE FOOD. SWIFT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO GENDER MAINSTREAMING IN AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD POLICIES BY PROVIDING THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL TOOLS (FEMINIST FARM VIABILITY INDICATORS AND GENDER RESPONSIVE BUDGETING IN POLICIES) TO FAVOR A CHANGE OF FRAMING IN THOSE POLICIES THAT WILL FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ALTERNATIVE FRAMINGS OF FOOD.

IN THAT CONTEXT, FLEXIBLE THERMOELECTRIC GENERATORS (TEGS) THAT CAPTURE THE BODY¿S HEAT AND CONVERT IT INTO ELECTRICAL ENERGY ARE A POTENTIALLY PROMISING AND SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVE. NEVERTHELESS, COMMERCIAL TEGS ARE PRODUCED ON RIGID SUBSTRATES, SO THEY CANNOT ADAPT TO THE HUMAN BODY. THE CURRENT SOLUTION PROPOSED IS TO PRODUCE THEM ON FLEXIBLE POLYMERIC SUBSTRATES, WHICH UNFORTUNATELY HAVE LOW THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY, THE ACTIVE POWER-GENERATING LAYER MUST BE VERY THICK, AND IT IS NOT EFFICIENT ENOUGH. ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS ARE NO GOOD ELECTRICAL AND THERMAL CONTACTS AND THE NON-AVAILABILITY OF COMMERCIAL LOW INPUT POWER DC-DC CONVERTERS. POWERBYU SEEKS TO MERGE FOUR SCIENTIFICALLY DISRUPTIVE CONCEPTS TO ACHIEVE THE TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH OF GETTING FLEXIBLE AND EFFICIENT ENOUGH FLEXIBLE TEGS: 1) GENERATE NOT YET EXISTING BIO-INSPIRED, NANO-ENGINEERED, FLEXIBLE POLYMERIC SUBSTRATES WITH VERY HIGH THERMAL CONDUCTIVITIES IN THE OUT-OF-PLANE DIRECTION. 2) GENERATE A BIO-INSPIRED PATTERNING OF THE POLYMER SURFACE TO DRIVE THE THERMAL FLOW FROM PERPENDICULAR TO PARALLEL TO THE ENERGY GENERATION LAYER. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEN, THE IMPORTANT LENGTH TO AVOID THERMALIZATION IS NOT THICKNESS BUT LATERAL SIZE. 3) PRODUCE WORLD-RECORD EFFICIENT QUASI-2D THERMOELECTRIC LAYERS GENERATED BY A UNIQUE DEPOSITION TOOL AND 4) NEW SOLUTIONS TO THE COMMERCIAL DC-DC CONVERTER.

THIS PROJECT TAKES A DECISIVE STEP TO FIX OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE SULPHUR CHEMISTRY WITH AN INNOVATIVE METHODOLOGY THAT RESTS ON THREE PILLARS: (I) TO CREATE AN UNPRECEDENTED DATABASE OF HIGH QUALITY OBSERVATIONS OF SULPHUR-BEARING MOLECULES WHICH ALLOWS US TO TRACE THE SULPHUR CONTENT FROM THE NATAL MOLECULAR CLOUDS TO PROTOPLANETARY DISKS. OBSERVATIONS OF THE AWARDED IRAM LARGE PROGRAM GEMS HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED PART OF THIS DATABASE. (II) TO PERFORM AB INITIO CALCULATIONS AND LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS TO ESTIMATE THE KEY REACTION RATES THAT ARE NEEDED TO FIX THE SULPHUR NETWORK AND MAKE CHEMICAL MODELS RELIABLE. NOW, WE KNOW THAT THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF PLANET-FORMING DISKS IS TO A LARGE EXTENT INHERITED FROM THE EARLIEST PHASES OF STAR FORMATION. (III) TO PERFORM BI-FLUID (GAS+DUST) 3D MAGNETO-HYDRODYNAMICS SIMULATIONS WITH CHEMISTRY COUPLED (CHEMO-MHD) TO FOLLOW THE CHEMICAL EVOLUTION OF THE MATERIAL FROM THE NATAL CLOUD TO THE PLANET-FORMING SITES, AND HENCE, TO OBTAIN ACCURATE CHEMICAL PREDICTIONS.

TODAY, MODELING HAS BECOME AN ESSENTIAL TOOL FOR INTERPRETING EXPERIMENTS AND AIDING MATERIALS DESIGN. HOWEVER, ACCURATELY DESCRIBING WEAK INTERACTIONS REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR MANY THEORETICAL APPROACHES. ATOMISTIC SIMULATIONS CAN HELP DECIPHER THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING COMPLEX PROCESSES, BUT PRECISE MOLECULAR POTENTIALS ARE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIONS OF THESE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PHENOMENA. DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS FIELD, THERE IS CURRENTLY NO SYSTEMATIC AND COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING AVAILABLE, PARTICULARLY IN THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THEORY, METHOD DEVELOPMENT, TECHNIQUES FOR RIGOROUS EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION, AND THE CREATION OF NEW MODELS USING DETAILED PHYSICAL UNDERSTANDING COMBINED WITH MACHINE LEARNING. THE PHYMOL NETWORK AIMS TO FILL THIS GAP BY BRINGING TOGETHER EXPERTS IN CHEMICAL PHYSICS, INTERMOLECULAR INTERACTIONS, SIMULATION AND MACHINE LEARNING, ALONG WITH SEVERAL INDUSTRIAL AND ACADEMIC PARTNERS. THIS PROGRAM WILL EXPLOIT THE SYNERGIES BETWEEN ACCURATE DESCRIPTIONS OF INTERMOLECULAR INTERACTIONS AND THE USE OF MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO GENERATE NEW MOLECULAR POTENTIALS.

THUS, CHARACTERIZING THE FILAMENTATION PHENOTYPE OPENS THE DOOR TO UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSIOLOGY AND ADAPTATION OF BACTERIAL CELLS UNDER STRESS AND DURING COLONIZATION PROCESSES. FILAMENTATION RESULTS FROM A COORDINATION OF GROWTH AND DIVISION DRIVEN BY THE ASSEMBLY MACHINERY OF THE FTS SYSTEM, THE MIN OSCILLATORY SYSTEM, AND THE NUCLEAR OCCLUSION SYSTEM. IN PARTICULAR, FTS PARTICIPATES IN SEPTUM ASSEMBLY, A RING-FORMING CELL WALL THAT SEPARATES DAUGHTER CELLS, WHILE THE MIN OSCILLATORY SYSTEM RESTRICTS THE ASSEMBLY OF THE DIVISION MACHINERY TO AVOID NUCLEOID CLEAVAGE. UNDER REGULAR GROWTH, A SINGLE SEPTUM FORMS SYMMETRICALLY TO SEPARATE THE NUCLEOIDS OF DAUGHTER CELLS. HOWEVER, DURING FILAMENTATION, MULTIPLE NUCLEOIDS SEGREGATE ALONG THE CELL AT REGULAR INTERVALS AND SEVERAL PUTATIVE SEPTA ARE CREATED. YET, FILAMENTOUS BACTERIA DO NOT GROW INDEFINITELY, AND DIVISION EVENTS OCCUR ¿RANDOMLY¿ IN TERMS OF TIMING AND SEPTUM SELECTION. THIS RAISES THE UNEXPLORED QUESTION OF HOW SIZE IS REGULATED DURING FILAMENTATION. IN THIS CONTEXT, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN MECHANICAL CUES (E.G., FILAMENT BENDING) AND CHANGES IN BACTERIAL MEMBRANE POTENTIAL PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN REGULATING FILAMENTATION.

CAJAL,"THIS PROJECT AIMS TO CREATE A NEW SMART ROBOT SYSTEM FOR LOWER-LIMB (JOINT ANKLE) NEURAL REHABILITATION, INCLUDING ITS TESTING BY INVOLVING MEDICAL END-USERS (A HOSPITAL WITH THEIR PATIENTS AND THERAPISTS). THE SOLUTION WILL CONSIDER AN INNOVATIVE STRUCTURE OF ROBOTIC EXOSKELETON BASED ON RIGID ACTUATORS ADAPTED TO THE JOINT ANKLE, AN ELECTRONIC CONTROL SYSTEM WITH WIRELESS COMMUNICATION AND A USER INTERFACE INSPIRED BY GAMIFICATION AND BIOFEEDBACK STRATEGIES. THE SOLUTION WILL HAVE ON-LINE COMMUNICATION WITH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE PATIENT, INCORPORATING REHABILITATION EXERCISES THAT ALLOW ADAPTING THE EXOSKELETON BEHAVIOR AUTOMATICALLY, ACHIEVING PERSONALIZED THERAPIES._x000D_ THE STARTING POINT OF THIS CAN BE FOUND IN THE RESULT OF THE SMARTWEARABLE PROJECT1, FUNDED BY THE H2020 PROJECT DIATOMIC¿S OPEN CALL AND FINALIZED IN NOVEMBER 20192, CONDUCTED BY TECHNAID AND CSIC (PARTICIPANTS OF THIS PROPOSAL). ONCE VALIDATED THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE ROBOTIC-BASED LOWER LIMB NEURAL REHABILITATION SOLUTIONS (TRL5), THE CURRENT DEMONSTRATOR AIMS TO SCALE IT UP TO AN OPERATIONAL PROTOTYPE (TRL7), BY INVOLVING THE PARTICIPATION OF A TOP-NOTCH SOFTWARE DEVELOPER AND A PUBLIC HOSPITAL AS END-USER TO VALIDATE IT WITH REAL USERS._x000D_ THUS, THIS PROJECT WILL BE ALIGNED WITH THE DIH-HERO¿S ADDRESSED HEALTHCARE ROBOTIC DOMAIN OF REHABILITATION ROBOTICS._x000D_ AIMING TO MEET ALL THE CALL REQUIREMENTS AND TO MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECT, A MULTIDISCIPLINARY AND COMPLEMENTARY CONSORTIUM HAS BEEN STABLISHED:_x000D_ ¿ TECHNAID3: A SPANISH SME WITH EXPERTISE CREATING WEARABLE ROBOTS FOR REHABILITATION THAT WILL LEAD THE PROJECT EXECUTION, FOCUSING SPECIALLY IN CONDUCTING THE MECHANICAL AND ELECTRONIC DEVELOPMENT._x000D_ ¿ CSIC: THE LARGEST SPANISH PUBLIC RESEARCH INSTITUTION THAT, THROUGH ITS THE NEURAL REHABILITATION GROUP (NRG) OF CAJAL INSTITUTE (THE OLDEST NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH CENTRE IN SPAIN)4, WILL PARTICIPATE AS KNOWLEDGE INSTITUTE PROVIDING SUPPORT WITH THE MECHANICAL DESIGN._x000D_ ¿ FHNP5: THE BIOMECHANICS AND TECHNICAL AIDS DEPARTMENT, BELONGING TO NATIONAL HOSPITAL FOR PARAPLEGICS, THE SPANISH TOP PUBLIC HOSPITAL IN SPINAL CORD INJURIES TREATMENT AND NEURAL REHABILITATION, THAT WILL PARTICIPATE AS END-USER FOR THE FIELD VALIDATION REHANKLE. IT WILL PARTICIPATE AS ENTITY DEPENDENT ON FUNDACION DEL HOSPITAL NACIONAL DE PARAPLEJICOS._x000D_ ¿ CAIXA6: A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER EXPERT PORTUGUESE SME WITH EXPERIENCE IN CREATING HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS THAT WILL OVERSEE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT THE IMMERSIVE INTERFACE WITH WHICH THE USER (PATIENT AND THERAPIST) WILL INTERACT._x000D_ THEREFORE, THE CONSORTIUM ENCOMPASSES A WIDE VALUE CHAIN, RANGING FROM AN SME EXPERT IN ROBOTICS FOR HEALTHCARE TO A PARAPLEGIC HOSPITAL AS END USER, AS WELL AS INCLUDING AN SME SPECIALIZED IN MULTI-SECTOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND A REFERENCE KNOWLEDGE ENTITY FOCUSED ON NEURONAL REHABILITATION SOLUTIONS. IN FACT, THIS VALUE CHAIN COMES FROM THE TECHNOLOGY TO THE FINAL PATIENT, ALSO INCORPORATING A PARTNER (CAIXA) THAT WORKS IN ORDER DOMAINS BESIDES HEALTHCARE._x000D_ FINALLY, TO GUARANTEE THE MEDICAL RELEVANCE OF THE PROJECT, THE END-USER (HOSPITAL AND THEIR PATIENTS AND THERAPISTS) WILL BE INVOLVED AT ALL STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, CONSIDERING THEIR PERSPECTIVE AS A HEALTH EXPERT. IN THIS MANNER, THE CONSORTIUM WILL DESIGN A TEST BENCH TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS NEW AND INNOVATIVE ROBOTIC SOLUTION FOR NEUROLOGICAL REHABILITATION IN HEALTHCARE.",,0,,,nan,,Pequeño (<100K)
